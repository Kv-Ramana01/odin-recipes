        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for heat)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>

    <h2>Instructions to make KFC!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, marinate the chicken pieces in buttermilk for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off, then dredge each piece in the flour mixture, ensuring it's well coated.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces in the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 12-15 minutes per batch.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your favorite sides like coleslaw, mashed potatoes, or biscuits.</li>
