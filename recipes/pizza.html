    <h2>Instructions to make pizza!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your choice of toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve your homemade pizza hot, enjoying the delightful flavors and aromas!</li>
