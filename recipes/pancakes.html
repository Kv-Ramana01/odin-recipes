    <h2>Instructions to make pancakes!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove the pancakes from the skillet and keep them warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with maple syrup, fresh fruits, or whipped cream, if desired.</li>
